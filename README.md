kartina is an open-source art project inspired by the song "Can I Take a Picture With You?" 
by Andrey Pushkarev.

My goal for this project is to demonstrate that 
art and computation are an ideal marriage of form and function.

To view the project, first clone the repository. 
Then, from inside the cloned repo type:
```
cargo run
```

### Enjoy.
